# Homework 17

You have one week to complete these problems. Complete them to the best of your ability and then submit them. Make sure your code works (compiles, runs, and passes the initial checks) before you submit it. You can always resubmit up until the deadline, but you will not receive any credit if your code does not run.

## Skills

This homework covers ArrayLists and sorting. You will most likely have to rely on previously learned skills to complete the problems, but the bulk of the work will practice these skills.

## As always...
Make sure that your code compiles and runs prior to submission; code that does not compile will receive a 0. If you are unable to solve a particular problem, return a default value; you will not earn the point for that question but I will be able to grade the others. Make sure you push your final work before the deadline.
